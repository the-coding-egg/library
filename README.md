# Egg's Library

## About

- A library showing the books that have I have read (I have read more, I swear...)
- This project focused on Javascript and the fundamentals of DOM Manipulation

## The Journey

- This project was fun and interesting. Started off with the basic HTML and then
  moved onto some basic CSS.
- From there the JS started. This is where it was a little more difficult.
  - Starting off with the arrays and getting my books to store in there. Also
    working on prototypes trying to understand how they worked. Those started to
    make sense throughout the project.
  - Then came the hard part of getting the books to display. I was able to get
    them to get on the page, but anytime I changed the DOM, they would refresh.
    Lot's of logic was worked throughout to make every button work correctly.
  - After all the logic was working, I tested it a few times, trying to find
    edge cases. Found some and corrected them.
- Last was cleaning up the CSS.
  - I went with a basic Tokyo Night colors with some hover effects. Not too bad.

## Stick around

- Stick around to see more projects as I keep moving through The Odin Project!
